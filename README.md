# SQL
A journey of learning SQL 


This repository documents my journey of learning SQL, from the fundamentals to advanced queries.  
I’m eager to strengthen my understanding of data handling, querying, and database design concepts through hands-on practice.  

Each folder or file in this repo reflects a topic I’ve explored, including:
- Table creation, joins, and normalization  
- Aggregate functions and subqueries  
- Healthcare and pharma-related data exercises  

I’ll keep updating
