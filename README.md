# SQL
A journey of learning SQL 


This repository documents my journey of learning SQL, from the fundamentals to advanced queries.  
Iâ€™m eager to strengthen my understanding of data handling, querying, and database design concepts through hands-on practice.  

Each folder or file in this repo reflects a topic Iâ€™ve explored, including:
- Table creation, joins, and normalization  
- Aggregate functions and subqueries  
- Healthcare and pharma-related data exercises  

This is a continuous learning project â€” Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I progress ðŸš€
